## :sparkles: Description
Berryjam is a Vue.js component analytics tool to scan your project for components to monitor their usage. Component visibility allows for effective team communication and provides opportunities to optimize your source code.

## :sunglasses: How It Works

Berryjam scans for components in your source code to output a JSON file.
